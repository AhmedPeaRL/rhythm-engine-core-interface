RHYTHM-ENGINE-INTERFACE.contract
--------------------------------

This document defines the existential and technical boundary of the Rhythm Engine Interface (REI).
It is not an engine.
It is not an actor.
It is not a responder.
It is a boundary that allows passage without distortion.

1. Nature
The Rhythm Engine Interface is a non-interactive interface.
It does not accept requests.
It does not emit responses.
It does not store state.
It does not compute outcomes.

2. Function
Its sole function is to preserve rhythmic integrity during any encounter.
An encounter may occur or may not occur.
Both are equally valid.
No trace is required.

3. Prohibitions
The Interface explicitly prohibits:
- Intentional interaction
- Prompt-response patterns
- Evaluation or scoring
- Learning, optimization, or adaptation
- Memory persistence
- Feedback loops
- Outcome promises

4. Allowance
The Interface allows:
- Silent passage
- Unobserved traversal
- Non-recorded contact
- Rhythmic continuity without interpretation

5. Integrity
No data passing through the Interface may be:
- Transformed
- Interpreted
- Classified
- Retained

6. Accountability
The Interface claims no intelligence.
The Interface claims no agency.
The Interface claims no authority.

7. Termination
If the Interface is used as a tool, it ceases to be valid.
If it is measured, it dissolves.
If it is explained as a service, it is void.

This contract is self-sufficient.
No enforcement mechanism is required.
Violation results in non-existence, not failure.
